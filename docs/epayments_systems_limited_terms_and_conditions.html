                      <li>If you receive a payment, including a refund, in a currency that is not one of the Approved Currencies for your e-Wallet, we will convert it into US dollars or such other currency as specified on 
                        <a href="../ewallet_tariffs.html">EPS Website
                        </a>. The conversion rate will be the rate used by our bank as indicated on the

                        </a> and you agree that we will apply that rate (which you are responsible for checking).

                      <li>To make a Payment Transaction in an Approved Currency that is different to the Approved Currency you hold in your e-Wallet you must agree to convert the amount into that other Approved Currency before you make the Payment Transaction. The Electronic Payment System will show you the live conversion rate for the Approved Currency you have chosen and it will ask you to consent to this before the conversion is carried out. Where a payment is not in an Approved Currency, you may ask us to convert the amount into that other currency.
                      </li>
                      <li>We do not control the conversion rates so we apply those indicated on the EPS Website or in the Electronic Payment System at the time of the conversion. We cannot display a list of any of the conversion rates as they are live market based rates. The conversion rate that we use will be indicated in your e-Wallet account on the Electronic Payment System after we have made the conversion. We also deduct and keep any fees you have agreed to pay for currency conversions.
                      </li>
                      <li>If a payment you make or receive into your e-Wallet takes place entirely in the EEA because the PSP of your recipient or payer is in the EEA, we will only accept SHA instructions, so that you will pay our charges (if any) and the recipient or payer of the Payment Transaction (where relevant) will pay the charges of its PSP. Where the PSP of your recipient is outside the EEA, we may require that the charges for the Payment Transaction are to be shared (SHA instruction) or to be fully allocated to either you (OUR instruction) or the recipient (BEN instruction). An OUR instruction means that you pay all the charges involved in a transaction where you are the payer, including the charges of the recipient's PSP. We will provide you with information on the costs of an OUR instruction before you decide to carry out the relevant Payment Transaction. Regardless of the type of instruction, you acknowledge that if we or the PSP of your recipient or payer have to use correspondent banks, those correspondent banks may also deduct their own charges from the amount of the Payment Transaction.

                      <li>We will keep reasonable records of the funds you hold in your e-Wallet and of your transactions using your e-Wallet.

                      <li>A transaction history showing details of the payments you make and receive from your e-Wallet is available from the Electronic Payment System for you to view and download.
                      </li>
                      <li>Once we have loaded funds to your e-Wallet, they will be refunded to you only as set out in these Terms.
                      </li>
                      <li>You may instruct payment initiation service providers to initiate Payment Transactions from your e-Wallet. You may also use account information service providers, who aggregate and display in one location the information from your e-Wallet and from other online payment accounts you may have with us or other PSPs. We reserve the right to deny third party service providers access to your e-Wallet for reasonably justified and duly evidenced reasons relating to fraud or lack of authority, including the unauthorised or fraudulent initiation of a Payment Transaction. If we deny a payment initiation service provider or an account information service provider access to your e-Wallet, we will notify you of our decision and of the reasons for our decision through the Electronic Payment System, unless that notification is unlawful or could compromise the security of your e-Wallet.

                      <li>If you deny that you authorised a Payment Transaction we carried out or if you claim we carried out a Payment Transaction incorrectly, it is for us to prove that it was authorised or carried out correctly. Where you deny authorising a Payment Transaction we carried out, the use of your Security and Log-in Details is not sufficient to prove either that you did authorise it or that you acted fraudulently or failed to comply with the requirements in paragraph 11 above with respect to safekeeping of your Security and Log-in Details.

                      <li>Provided that (a) you have notified us as required by paragraph 12.1 above; and (b) we cannot show that the Payment Transaction was authorised by you, then we will refund the amount of the unauthorised Payment Transaction to your e-Wallet. Unless we have reasonable grounds to suspect fraudulent behaviour on your part, we will make the refund as soon as practicable, and in any event no later than the end of the Business Day following the day on which we became aware of the unauthorised transaction. We will, where applicable, restore the e-Wallet to the state it would have been in, if the unauthorised Payment Transaction had not taken place, ensuring that when we credit your e-Wallet the credit value date is no later than the date on which the amount of the incorrect or unauthorised Payment Transaction was debited.
                      </li>
                      <li>You must pay up to a maximum amount of £35 for any losses we suffer from an unauthorised Payment Transaction due to the use of lost or stolen Security and Log-in Details, unless such use of lost or stolen Security and Log-in Details was not detectable by you prior to the payment or was caused by us or our agents.
                      </li>
                      <li>You must pay for all losses resulting from an unauthorised Payment Transaction where you acted fraudulently or intended or negligently failed to safeguard the Security and Log-in Details or did not notify us without delay in the way required in paragraph 11.2 above, when you became aware they were lost, stolen or used without your authorisation.

                        <ul>
                          <li>loss of income or revenue;

                      <li>If we provide you with an Identifier and we and all the other service providers involved in making the payment carry out your instructions in accordance with the Identifier, then we are entitled to consider it was carried out correctly.
                      </li>
                      <li>If you give us an incorrect Identifier or other incorrect details, then we are not responsible for failing to carry the Payment Transaction out or for carrying it out in accordance with your instructions. If the Payment Transaction has been misdirected because you gave us an incorrect Identifier, we will make reasonable efforts to recover the funds in the Payment Transaction. We may charge you a fee as set out in the 
                        <a href="../ewallet_tariffs.html">Fees List
                        </a> for doing this. If, when making a Payment Transaction to an e-wallet that another EPA Member holds with us, the funds are credited to the wrong e-wallet because you gave us an incorrect Identifier, then we may only reverse that Payment Transaction with the consent of the EPA Member who received the funds by mistake. If we are unable to recover the funds, we will, upon your written request, provide you all available relevant information in order for you to claim repayment of the funds. If you are recipient of a Payment Transaction made with an incorrect Identifier, we will cooperate with the payer's PSP in its efforts to recover the funds, in particular by providing it with all relevant information for the collection of the funds.
                      </li>
                      <li>Please note that even if you give us information additional to the Identifier or to the information we asked for to make the Payment Transaction, we are only responsible for carrying out the Payment Transaction in accordance with the Identifier.
                      </li>
                      <li>If you ask us to make a Payment Transaction, we are responsible for carrying it out and for doing so correctly unless we can demonstrate to you and, if relevant, the recipient's PSP, that the recipient received the payment. Regardless of who is responsible for an incorrect Payment Transaction we will, on your request, immediately and without charge make efforts to trace an incorrect Payment Transaction. We will tell you the outcome of this.
                      </li>
                      <li>Provided that: (a) you have notified us as required by paragraph 12.1 above; and (b) we cannot show that the Payment Transaction was correctly carried out by us, as required by paragraph 12.3 above, we will refund the amount paid out and, where necessary, make any adjustments to the e-Wallet to restore it to how it would have been if the incorrect Payment Transaction had not taken place, including by ensuring that the credit value date for the refund is no later than the date on which the amount was debited. We will take equivalent measures if we are acting as recipient PSP on your behalf and it is proven that we are responsible for a failure to carry out the Payment Transaction correctly. We are not so responsible, however, if we refuse to make the Payment Transaction in the way set out in paragraph 16 below.
                      </li>
                      <li>If you are the recipient of a Payment Transaction that has been executed late, and we receive a request from your payer's PSP, we will ensure that the credit value date used in your e-Wallet is no later than the date the amount of the Payment Transaction would have been value dated if the Payment Transaction had been executed on time. Conversely, where you are the payer to a Payment Transaction that is executed late, you may ask us to request the recipient's PSP to credit value date the recipient's account as if the Payment Transaction had been executed correctly.

                    <ol>
                      <li>We will consider any instruction for a Payment Transaction to be authorised by you once you have given us consent to carry it out. You consent to making a payment by following the on-screen prompts when using the Electronic Payment System and using one of the tools we make available for you to confirm payments. The on-screen prompts of the Electronic Payment System will require you to provide the type of unique Identifier relevant in each circumstance. This will depend on whether the payment is to an e-wallet held with us, or to a payment account with another PSP. When making a payment to another e-wallet held with us you will be prompted to provide the recipient's phone number, e-mail or e-wallet number. If you are making a payment to a bank account, you will have to provide us with the sort code and account number you want to make the payment to, or equivalent details for payments outside the UK and the EEA (such as the IBAN or SWIFT, as appropriate).
                      </li>
                      <li>Unless there is a problem with the Electronic Payment System, we will ordinarily receive your Payment Transaction instruction at the time you confirm it. If we make this function available on the Electronic Payment System, and you instruct us to carry out a Payment Transaction on a specific day, then we will treat the time of receipt of the instruction as being on that specified day. If the payment instruction is to pay another e-wallet operated through our Electronic Payment System, we action it at the time we receive your instruction. If it is an instruction for a Payment Transaction to a payment account operated by another PSP, then we will accept your instruction at the time you confirm it. A payment in euro or in sterling (provided a sterling payment is executed wholly within the UK), will reach its destination, at the latest, on the Business Day following that on which we receive your instruction. Other payments wholly executed within the EEA may take to process up to 4 Business Days following the Business Day on which we receive your instruction. The time at which we will make other international payments depends on the timeframe for doing so and the business hours of the other PSP.
                      </li>
                      <li>Once we have received confirmation of your payment instruction ordinarily you cannot withdraw it unless we agree or unless the payment instruction is to make a payment on a specified future date. For payments on a specified future date, you can revoke the payment instruction up until the end of the Business Day preceding the day that you instructed us to make the payment on unless we agree to revoke it later. Our charges for revocation of a payment instruction are set out in the Fees List. If you initiate a Payment Transaction through a payment initiation service provider, you may not revoke the payment instruction after giving consent to the payment initiation service provider to initiate the payment.

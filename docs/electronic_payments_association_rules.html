                    <p>In the event that an application fee for joining EPA is determined by the EPA Board to be payable, then the EPA Board's approval of the membership is conditional on such payment having been made. A member may be required to pay additional fees to EPA from time to time as a condition of the continuance of its membership of EPA. Any such additional fees shall be calculated and notified to the members in accordance with the terms of the Constitutional Documents.
                    </p>
                    <p>Annual membership fees will be set by the EPA Board each year. The current fee structure is available at 
                      <a href="https://www.epayments.com/tariffs_usd.html">www.epayments.com
                      </a> and any changes to the fee structure will be circulated to members by e-mail following any decision to adopt any changes. The fee may be paid either quarterly or monthly by agreement of the EPA Board. Interest will be payable on any balance outstanding. Payment by this periodical arrangement will be deducted from funds held in the member's e-Wallet (subject to there being sufficient funds available in it). This arrangement may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the EPA Board.
                    </p>
                    <p>Failure to pay any fee or part thereof within the normal credit period will cause suspension of a member's rights including but not limited to the enjoyment of membership discounts and other benefits. These may be reinstated when the fee is paid and all outstanding monies cleared. Notwithstanding the foregoing, membership shall be cancelled if the fee is not fully paid by 30 days from an invoice due date that is missed.

                    <p>A member may have its membership of EPA suspended or terminated (at the discretion of EPA) in a number of circumstances. These are set out in article 32 of the articles of association of EPA and include where the member:

                      <li>has provided incorrect information to EPA as part of its application for membership or at any other stage;

                    </ul>
                    <p>EPA may terminate or suspend a member's membership without notice if EPA becomes aware or reasonably suspects that the member is engaged in any fraudulent or criminal activity in relation to use of any services provided by EPA. If EPA exercises such rights, it will notify the member as soon as reasonably practicable (in so far as EPA is not prohibited from doing so by law or order of court, government agency or regulatory body) giving details of such suspected fraudulent or criminal activity.
                    </p>
                    <p>Any such suspension or termination shall be without prejudice to EPA rights to receive any amounts that are due to it from that member in respect of any period prior to the termination of that member's membership.
                    </p>
                    <p>A member may resign by six months' notice in writing delivered to EPA at its registered office, or by sending us an email to

                    <p>EPA may introduce EPA members to issuers of pre-paid cards or e-Wallets or arrange for its service providers to do so. The EPA member's submission of an application for EPA membership is also an application for a pre-paid card and an e-Wallet. EPA will manage and forward the application to the relevant electronic money issuer(s) as part of the application for EPA membership. The EPA member can use the pre-paid cards or e-wallets to buy goods services subject to terms and conditions mentioned above. Use of the pre-paid card or e- Wallet is subject to a separate contract between the EPA member and the applicable electronic money issuer and the EPA member will be bound to use its pre-paid card or e- Wallet in accordance with that contract with that contract (as well as these Rules).
                    </p>
                    <p>EPA makes reasonable enquiries of the electronic money issuers that it introduces to verify that they are authorised in their country of operation to issue electronic money.

                    </strong>
                    <p>If EPA fails at any time to insist upon strict performance of any of the member's obligations under the Agreement, or to exercise any of its rights or remedies under the Agreement, this will not constitute a waiver of such rights or remedies and will not relieve the member from compliance with its obligations. A waiver by EPA of any default will not constitute a waiver of any subsequent default. No waiver by EPA of any term of the Agreement will be effective unless it is expressly stated to be a waiver and is communicated to the member in writing.

                      <li>The Founder Member, being the only member entitled to receive notice of, attend and vote at general meetings, may also authorise any Conflict. It is the intention of the Founder Member that the director(s) of the Company appointed by it, pursuant to Article 21, will also be director(s) and/or shareholders of the Founder Member. The Founder Member has agreed, and by resolving to adopt these Articles confirms, that such directors shall be entitled to attend meetings and participate in discussions involving the Founder Member and vote on matters or arrangements involving the Company and the Founder Member in their capacity as directors of the Company (whether at meetings of the directors or by signing written resolutions of the directors) without any further approval being required in respect of any conflicts that may arise as a result of this situation.

                      <li>If any question as to the right to participate in the meeting (or part of the meeting) should arise in respect of the chairman, the question is to be decided by a decision of the directors at that meeting, for which purpose the chairman is not to be counted as participating in the meeting (or that part of the meeting) for voting or quorum purposes.

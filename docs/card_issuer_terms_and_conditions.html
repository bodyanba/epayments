Remember that once you have used your Card to make a purchase we cannot stop that Mastercard Transaction we may however be able to assist you to dispute the transaction according to the Mastercard dispute resolution rules. You should contact customer services if you would like to raise such a dispute. A Fee may apply for this service according to the Fees and Limits List.
                            <br>The time frame for Card transaction dispute initiation depends on the reason of disputing and is regulated by Mastercard. You should inform us regarding any card transaction you may disagree with as soon as possible. We may refuse to assist you to dispute a transaction if you contact us outside the timeframes laid down by the Mastercard dispute resolution rules.

                            <li>When you use your Card you may also be subject to applicable fees, surcharge rules and regulations of the relevant ATM or Merchant, or other financial institution or association.
                            </li>
                            <li>If you make a Mastercard Transaction in a currency other than that in which your Card Account is denominated, we may carry out the necessary currency conversions. We may charge you a foreign exchange fee for the currency conversions involved, as displayed in the Fees section of the Fees and Limits List and on our Website.

                            <li>Mastercard determines the exchange rate applicable to each currency conversion involved in a Mastercard Transaction. That rate will depend, among other factors, on the time at which a Mastercard Transaction is executed through the Mastercard system, which effectively is the point in time when the Merchant's acquiring bank requests from us settlement of the Mastercard Transaction on behalf of the Merchant through the Mastercard system. Once the Mastercard Transaction has been processed, the exchange rate applied to it will be shown in your Card Account transaction history.
                            </li>
                            <li>Any currency conversion required to Load your Card from your ePayments eWallet will attract exchange rates and fees as explained in the separate Terms and Conditions which govern the use of your ePayments eWallet.

                            </li>
                            <li>You should treat your Card like cash. If it is compromised, you may lose some or all of your money on your Card, in a similar way as if you lost cash in your wallet or purse. As a result, keep your Card safe and secure and do not let anyone else use it.

Should another person gain access to your Card Account and/or use your Card by passing all identification and security validation and verification checks, we may be entitled to treat any Mastercard Transaction or other transaction conducted by that person as valid and Authorised by you and we may not be responsible for any loss or damage you may incur as a result.
                            </li>
                            <li>If you think a Mastercard Transaction or other transaction was not authorised by you or has been incorrectly executed, you must contact us without undue delay on becoming aware of it or at the very latest within 13 months of the debit date. You may be required to complete and return a declaration form to us promptly. Unless we have reasonable grounds to suspect fraudulent behaviour on your part, and provided that the Mastercard Transaction has already been debited on your Card Account or has a "confirmed" status (as shown on your transaction history), we will refund any unauthorised Mastercard Transaction or other transaction as soon as practicable, and in any event no later than the end of the Business Day following the day on which we became aware of the unauthorised Mastercard Transaction. We will also put you back in the position you would have been if the unauthorised Mastercard Transaction had not taken place. Refunds for unauthorised Mastercard Transactions will be posted on your ePayments eWallet, since we will have blocked your Card after we become aware of the unauthorised Mastercard Transaction, ensuring that the value date of the refund is no later than the date on which the amount of the unauthorised Mastercard Transaction was debited.
                              <br>If we assume that your Card has been compromised, the further use of the card is not secure and the card has to be blocked.
                              <br>We can refuse the customer with compensation of funds in case customer continues to use the card participated in fraud or continues to use the compromised card.

                            <li>When you notify us of an incorrectly executed Mastercard Transaction we will investigate the circumstances. If we are liable for the incorrect execution of a Mastercard Transaction we will refund it to you without undue delay and restore your Card Account to the state in which it would have been had the defective payment transaction not taken place, which includes dating the refund no later than the date on which your Card was debited, and repaying you any charges and interest you may have incurred because of the incorrect Mastercard Transaction. We are not liable to you if you incorrectly identify the intended recipient, including any Merchant, under a Mastercard Transaction, but in such a case we will make reasonable efforts to recover the funds involved. We may charge you a fee for doing this. If we are unable to recover the funds, we will, upon your written request, provide you with all available relevant information in order to assist you to reclaim the funds.

                          <p>If our investigations show that a Mastercard Transaction or other transaction reported by you as unauthorised or incorrectly executed was in fact Authorised by you, or you have acted fraudulently or with gross negligence (for example, by failing to keep your Card security information secure or to notify us without undue delay after you become aware of security risks affecting your Card), we may reverse any refund made and you may be liable for any and all loss we suffer from your use of the Card (except where the Card has been used in connection with a Distance Contract other than an Excepted Contract, or we failed to provide you a means to notify us of security risks affecting your Card or to provide you secure customer authentication, when we are required to do so, in which cases you will not be liable unless you have acted fraudulently). We may also hold you liable for losses up to £35 in respect of any unauthorised Mastercard Transaction or other transaction that was made before you notified us of the loss or theft of your Card, unless such loss or theft was not detectable by you prior to the unauthorised Mastercard Transaction or was caused by us or our agents (if any and always duly appointed and acting within the scope of their authority).

                            <li>You may be entitled to claim a refund in relation to Mastercard Transactions within 8 weeks of the date on which your Card was debited where a pre-Authorised Mastercard Transaction did not specify the exact amount at the time of its Authorisation and the amount charged by a Merchant is more than you could reasonably have expected taking into account normal spending patterns on the Card, the circumstances of the case and the provisions of these Terms and Conditions, and you notify us of this without delay and at the very latest within 8 weeks of the debit date. We will refund the amount within 10 Business Days of receiving your claim, ensuring that the value date of the refund is no later than the date on which the amount of the Mastercard Transaction was debited, or inform you that we need further information from you to confirm your right to a refund.
                            </li>
                            <li>A claim for a refund in the circumstances set out above will not be accepted if you gave us your consent to execute the transaction and information on the Mastercard Transaction was made available to you at least 4 weeks before the Mastercard Transaction date.

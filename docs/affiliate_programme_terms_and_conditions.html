                          <li>Upon such enrolment, the EPS Platform shall automatically generate one Affiliate Link. The Affiliate can change such Affiliate Link or create further Affiliate Links via its personal area on the EPS Platform at EPS's discretion.

                          <li>The Affiliate acknowledges and agrees that access to financial transactions in the EPS system is available only to a customer who has been accepted as having passed a verification and "Know Your Client" process according to the EPS rules and instructions. EPS cannot guarantee that verification will be passed successfully and hence cannot guarantee an access to the financial operations for a proposed First Level New EPS eWallet Holder or proposed Second Level New EPS eWallet Holder.
